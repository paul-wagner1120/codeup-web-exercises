  <dt class="question"><a href="#">Where can we soak in the thermal springs?</a></dt>
  <dd class="answer invisible">There are only three locations to see and touch the thermal springs. The natural springs are about 143F, which is too hot for soaking, so the only way to soak in the thermal water is to use one of the two Bathhouses on the Row that still offer bathing experiences – the Quapaw and the Buckstaff.

  <dt class="question"><a href="">How much water is used every day?</a></dt>
  <dd class="answer invisible">Hot Springs National Park goes through about 700,000 gallons of water per day. Several Bathhouses and drinking fountains have been built so people can enjoy the water that has given the park and the city its name.</dd>
  <br>
  <dt class="question"><a href="">How is the water heated?</a></dt>
  <dd class="answer invisible">Geologists and hydrologists tell us that this is not a volcanic area. This water is heated in a different way, a process known as geothermal gradient. When rain falls on the mountains around Hot Springs, pores and cracks in the rock take some of the water deep into the Earth. As the water goes deeper and deeper, its heat increases about 4 degrees [Fahrenheit] for every 300 feet it descends. This heated water dissolves minerals from the rocks it passes through them. Eventually the water seeps into joints and cracks leading it back up. The water comes to the surface right here, at the base of Hot Springs Mountain.</dd>

  <dt class="question"><a href="">Who founded the park? / By when was it created?</a></dt>
  <dd class="answer invisible">In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson was putting together a great expedition, led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, and as he was working on getting this great expedition on its way, he started to hear talk from the French and Spanish trappers about hot water coming straight from the ground. And because of this talk, President Jefferson decided to send another expedition out, led by George Hunter and William Dunbar. We refer to it as the Forgotten Expedition. Because of their report President Jefferson decided that the Federal Government needed to protect the springs. However, it was not until Andrew Jackson became President that this area was set aside in 1832 to protect the hot waters for future use. This type of Reservation was an early version of the National Park idea.  Hot Springs was the first area in the United States to be set aside for its natural features.  After Yellowstone was formed in 1872, Hot Springs was managed with it. In 1916 the National Park Service was formed and in 1921, Hot Springs Reservation changed its name to Hot Springs National Park, becoming the eighteenth National Park.</dd>
